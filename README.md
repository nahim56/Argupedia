Modern debate platforms do not provide sophisticated and structured ways to form arguments and debate with others. Arguments tend to lack structure and assertions can be made without any context or proof. Arguments are also not evaluated under a formal method for evaluation.
This project aims to solve this issue by building an application called Argupedia that allows users to form arguments using structured argumentation schemes, which users can then reply to by responding to a critical question related to that scheme. these arguments can be evaluated using argumentation theory, and then be visualised in a graph to give users a clear view on which arguments are winning and losing.
This project was built using Django, Javascript, SQlite, and Python.
